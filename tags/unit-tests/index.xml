      <description>Although the concepts of software testing were around for decades, the interest among developers started to grow only in past few years. Unfortunately, there is no definitive guide how to test, instead there are as many opinions on this topic as there are developers. In this post i&amp;rsquo;d like to share my thoughts about the benefits of different kind of tests.
The kind of tests i&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about are unit tests, integration tests and system tests.</description>
