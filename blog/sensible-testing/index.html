<p>Although the concepts of software testing were around for decades,
the interest among developers started to grow only in past few years.
Unfortunately, there is no definitive guide how to test,
instead there are as many opinions on this topic as there are developers.
In this post i&rsquo;d like to share my thoughts about the benefits of different kind of tests.</p>

<p>The kind of tests i&rsquo;d like to talk about are unit tests, integration tests and system tests.
I will tell what I think they are and when to use them or not.
How to implement the tests and what exactly to test is not part of this post.</p>

<h2 id="unit-tests">Unit Tests</h2>

<p>Unit tests test small pieces of code in isolation.
The smallest testable unit in OOP world is usually a method.
To achieve the isolation every dependency of the tested unit should be mocked,
i.e. the only production code in the whole test is the one that&rsquo;s being tested.
The purpose of the other code is to create conditions,
which should lead to desired behavior of the unit.
The key concepts of unit tests are fast execution and simple setup.
Unit tests do not only prove that your unit works as expected,
but also warn the developers if it doesn&rsquo;t anymore after later changes.</p>

<p>As the unit tests are located at the very bottom of the test stack one might ask,
why should I write dozens of unit tests if one or two system tests will cover the same functionality.
The answer is fast execution.
While tests on higher level might find a bug as well,
they usually require full, or at least partial, start of the application.
Another benefit that only unit tests provide is documentation of the code.
Depending on how clean the tests are, every developer will be able to see what the unit is supposed to do.</p>

<p>My advice- you should never skip unit tests.</p>

<h2 id="integration-tests">Integration Tests</h2>

<p>You can find tons of information about integration tests on the internet except everything you actually want to know.
There are thousands of articles explaining big bang, top down and bottom up approaches,
and even discussions which approach is the best.
But no one really explains how to get started.
So what actually integration tests boil down to is unit tests without mocks.
Well not completely without mocks, but at least first level dependencies should be production code.</p>

<p>While integration test <strong>are</strong> unit tests, they do not have any of their advantages.
They are slow in the best case.
The setup is much more complicated.
In most applications the benefit of integration tests will be small,
but they will significantly slow down the development and can even demotivate the team, if not used carefully.
Also the documentation purpose is no longer valid for them.
On top of it, system tests will cover integration of modules as well and they are even cheaper to read,
write and execute.
However there are cases when integration tests are sensible.
For instance, they are useful in development of libraries and frameworks,
where it is crucial that every unit is working well with every other possible unit.</p>

<p>My advice- don&rsquo;t do integration tests unless you absolutely need them.</p>

<h2 id="system-tests">System Tests</h2>

<p>This kind of tests will test your whole system as a black box.
They don&rsquo;t test units, but rather complete scenarios.
For example, if your application is a REST service, then system tests will send requests and validate the responses.
Just as unit tests, the system tests serve as documentation, so writing them as clean as you can is worth the effort.
Single system test should be able to run repeatedly without restarting the application.
That way it is possible to use them for TDD efficiently, especially if the platform is capable of hot swap.</p>

<p>My advice- It is usually a good idea to have system tests.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Unit and system tests can greatly speed up the development of applications, when used properly.
Integration tests will probably slow down the development,
but only this kind of tests is able to test interaction between components in systems,
that will be configured by users, e.g. libraries or frameworks.</p>
