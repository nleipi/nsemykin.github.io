      <description>Although the concepts of software testing were around for decades, the interest among developers started to grow only in past few years. Unfortunately, there is no definitive guide how to test, instead there are as many opinions on this topic as there are developers. In this post i&amp;rsquo;d like to share my thoughts about the benefits of different kind of tests.
The kind of tests i&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about are unit tests, integration tests and system tests.</description>

      <description>Over past few years I developed a technique of designing interfaces. At the time I took note of this approach I was already using it for quite a while. It kind of became my standard way of solving some problems as it has proven to be useful. I call this technique &amp;ldquo;client is king&amp;rdquo;. It is seemingly trivial and is more a way of thinking than some smart design pattern.</description>

      <description>Ladies and gentlemen, much of what you&amp;rsquo;ve seen may be termed as illusions or entertaining trifles. Alas&amp;hellip;I cannot claim this next feat as illusion. Watch carefully. You will see no trickery, for no trickery is employed. Merely a technique familiar to certain citizens of the Orient and various holy men of the Himalayas. Indeed, many of you may be familiar with this technique, but for those of you who are not, do not be alarmed.</description>
