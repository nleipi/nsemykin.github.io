      <description>Over past few years I developed a technique of designing interfaces. At the time I took note of this approach I was already using it for quite a while. It kind of became my standard way of solving some problems as it has proven to be useful. I call this technique &amp;ldquo;client is king&amp;rdquo;. It is seemingly trivial and is more a way of thinking than some smart design pattern.</description>
